I am a software developer who is passionate about his craft and is eager to learn and grow. I enjoy being a part of a great team that builds useful software that helps people around the world do their daily jobs with less effort.  

In my current role as a DotNet developer, I take customer requirements and airline industry standards and turn them into code that allows airline messaging systems to communicate. I like to use a test-driven development to write testable code and can refactor legacy C# code as needed to make it easier to maintain.

My career goal is to evolve as a software engineer by continuous learning, working with highly skilled and passionate IT professionals, and trying new technologies. So I keep reading about software engineering, DevOps practices, software testing, and apply what I learned.
